                    The ECDC employs degreed teachers. Quality in early childhood programmes is directly corelated with teachers who have the knowledge, education and skills to teach young children.
                    ECDC teachers understand child development, know how children learn and the most effective curriculum for young children to develop knowledge, skills attributes and a disposition for learning now and into the future.

                    Our Family Outreach Programme aims to promote early learning and care within the home environment. It targets the most vulnerable families with young children who cannot attend an ECD centre. Caregivers are often unemployed or have informal, inconsistent work, and are at home with their young child(ren). The programme provides a package of support to the families we work with.

                <p><b>ECD Centre Registration</b></p>
                <p>
                    According to the Children’s Act No. 38 of 2005, ECD centres must register as a partial care facility and/or after-care services with the Department of Social Development if they are looking after seven (7) or more children, and must adhere to the Minimum Norms and Standards. (These Norms and Standards can be found here).
                    The process involves working with the service provider responsible for your area and providing the required documentation, certificates and clearances (See Checklist for Required Documentation, Form 11, and Form 16) that are needed to compile a portfolio of evidence for your ECD centre. Once this portfolio is complete, the service provider delivers this to the Department of Social Development, where the portfolio is approved and a registration certificate is provided. The service provider then provides the registration certificate to the ECD centre.
                    CECD has a group of ECD assistants that visit ECD centres in our areas to assist with the registration process. CECD also has an ECD assistant based at our office in Claremont, with whom you can contact to set up an appointment for assistance or delivery of documentation for your portfolio.
                    Prior to 1 October 2017 and the involvement of service providers, the Department of Social Development was responsible for the full registration process. However, there was insufficient capacity in the Department and thus there were significant delays in the registering of ECD centres. To reduce this backlog, service providers (like CECD) were brought in due to their existing relationships with ECD centres, their expertise in the field and their capacity to efficiently work through the process of registration with centres.
                    Improving the registration process for ECD centres is critical for their sustainability and their capacity to offer quality early learning programmes. Quality early childhood development is fundamental to social and economic prosperity, eliminating inequality and the advancement of child rights.                </p>
